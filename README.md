# Brief

You have to develop a two-page application using the latest version of Angular you are experienced with - ideally 13 and up if you have exposure

You can use any online app development platform like Stackblitz to edit/save your code. (Stackblitz would be our preference, so brownie points for using Stackblitz)

You should be able to run and demonstrate the app in the interview.

The default page should display a list of posts with pagination - 10 at a time with next and prev buttons. The data should be loaded from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

The default page should have an Input text to filter the posts by userName fetched from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

When clicked on a post, it should load the post details on a new page.

Users should be able to navigate back from the post detail page via a button.

Minimal default native styles will do but you can use any UI library if you need (like angular material or bootstrap etc).
